Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Japan showed up with 0.0% chance beyond 100.000 for N

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 seems to be the tipping point, beyond the results change too much
